# albert-jmp-connector
Codebase for Albert JMP Integration for using JMP to query Albert data. 

# Important Note: 
These scripts are written & designed to specifically work within JMP's Python Environment. They will not run in standard venvs.
Additionally, updates to the scripts have to be manually compiled via editing the add-in file via JMPs UI. 

# Making Updates Post V1.2: 
Formatting has been standardized within JMP. Updates still must be manually compiled within the JMP add-in UI. However, all names have been standardized and all JSL code has been moved to individual files with standard naming.
For future updates, the updated file just needs to be added under "Additional Files" once the previous version has been removed. No other changes should be needed for updates.
